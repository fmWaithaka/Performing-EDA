# Insurance Claims Fraud Detection - Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
In this project, we conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of insurance claims, aiming to uncover patterns and insights related to fraudulent claims. The dataset comprises 15,420 claim instances, with 923 identified as fraudulent. Each claim instance is characterized by 33 predictor variables, including Month, WeekOfMonth, DayOfWeek, Make, AccidentArea, and others. The target variable, FraudFound_P, indicates whether a claim is fraudulent (1) or not (0).

## Objectives
This project is open-ended, encouraging a creative and curious approach to exploring the data. Our primary objectives include:

### Fraudulent Claim Characteristics
Identify patterns in fraudulent claims compared to non-fraudulent claims, analyzing demographics, Fault, Policy type, deductible vehicle information, and other relevant variables.

### Temporal Analysis
Explore the correlation between the time a claim is made (month, week of month, day of the week) and the likelihood of it being fraudulent, aiming to identify temporal patterns in fraud occurrences.

### Demographic Analysis
Examine how demographic factors (age, sex, marital status) correlate with the incidence of fraud, seeking insights into which demographics are more prone to committing fraud or being victims.

### Policy and Claim Analysis
Analyze how different policy types, policy details, and claim details relate to fraud cases, providing insights into the relationship between insurance policies and fraudulent activities.

### Vehicle-Related Insights
Investigate insights from the vehicle category, price, age of the vehicle, and their relationship with fraudulent claims.

### Geographical Patterns
Explore whether the accident area (urban vs. rural) has an impact on the likelihood of a claim being fraudulent.

### Claim Reporting and Processing
Investigate the role of variables such as the day of the week the claim was reported, police involvement, witness presence, and agent/broker involvement in detecting fraud.

### Impact of Previous Claims
Examine how the history of past claims relates to the likelihood of a current claim being fraudulent.

### Behavioral Indicators
Explore indicators like changes in address before making a claim, the number of cars under policy, or the number of supplements added to a claim as potential predictors for fraud.

### Modeling Predictive Indicators
Identify the most predictive variables for fraudulent activity and explore how these insights can be used to build a predictive model for fraud detection.

## Conclusion
Through this EDA, we aim to visualize and quantify relationships within the data, providing a foundation for understanding and detecting fraudulent claims. These insights can contribute not only to immediate fraud detection but also to the development of more sophisticated models for future fraud prevention in the insurance domain.
